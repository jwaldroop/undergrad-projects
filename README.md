## Early Warning Systems and the Role of Humans

My senior thesis was a comprehensive academic research paper on the integral role of the human element in early warning systems, with a particular focus on military early warning systems that use indication and warning methodologies.

Systems/Events discussed:
  - Able Archer '83 (USA)/Operation RYaN (USSR) (1983)
  - NORAD Incidents (1979-80)
  - Black Brant Scare (1995 - Norway/Russian Federation)
  - Hawaii Emergency Management Agency False Alert (2018 - USA)
  - UN Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS)

The logic, theory, and technological applications involved in the development of the RYaN system by the USSR is one of the most fascinating and truly impressive feats of the time.

## MP Party Affiliation: How it Influenced Constituents' Votes in the EU Referendum

This paper is a literature review of how/if Members of Parliament party affiliation influenced and/or affected constituency votes for the EU Referendum (Brexit).

This lit review stopped short of data analysis due to time constraints, but with the UK officially out of the EU, this would be an interesting project to continue researching.

### Abstract:
When UK citizens voted via national referendum to leave the European Union, there was an international reaction. While there have been many studies on the regional and demographic variables that have influenced voter behavior, there are not currently any studies on if Members of Parliament political party affiliation influenced their constituents voting behavior in the EU referendum. This paper looks at if and how MPs political affiliation influenced individuals in the Brexit vote by looking at individual level data that’s already been collected, with a proposal for additional data to be gathered and compared. I argue that constituents were not influenced by their MP’s party affiliation in the Brexit vote and that there is a serious issue with effective MP representation of their constituency.
